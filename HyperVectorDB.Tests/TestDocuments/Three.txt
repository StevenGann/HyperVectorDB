In a world where names hold ancient lore,
She walks a path that none explore,
A woman named Three, a tale untold,
Her spirit fierce, her heart pure gold.

With eyes that glimmer like the dawn,
She weaves her way through fields of fawn,
Each step a whisper, soft and free,
The gentle cadence of a symphony.

Her name, a riddle, simple, yet profound,
Three, a mystery, where meanings abound,
Three seasons, three stars, three lines of fate,
A symbol of balance, a sacred state.

In the morning light, she dances with the dew,
Her laughter a melody the world once knew,
A song of courage, of dreams set free,
In the rhythm of her name, the power of Three.

Beneath the moon, her secrets lie,
In shadows deep where echoes sigh,
She cradles hopes, she guards the dreams,
Of silent nights and starlit beams.

Three loves, three lives, a trinity,
Each bound by threads of destiny,
A mother, a maiden, a crone wise and old,
In her name, these stories unfold.

She is the dawn, the dusk, the twilightâ€™s hue,
A tapestry of red, gold, and blue,
A woman named Three, an enigma so grand,
With the world in her heart, and stars in her hand.
